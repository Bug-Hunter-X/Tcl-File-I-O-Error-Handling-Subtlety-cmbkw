# Tcl File I/O Error Handling
This example demonstrates a subtle error handling issue in Tcl when dealing with file I/O.  The `read_file` procedure attempts to read a file that may not exist.  The primary issue is the lack of robust error handling; the code doesn't explicitly check the return value of `open` for errors and handle them gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior when the file is not found. 
The solution offers a more robust approach using `catch` to trap errors and provides informative error messages.
